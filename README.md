# LINEAR-VS-RIDGE-VS-LASSO-REGRESSION

Dive into the intricacies of Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression with this enlightening project! Explore the nuances of each regression technique and gain key insights into their strengths, pitfalls, and applications in machine learning.

Key Insights:

Linear Regression Pitfall:

Uncover the pitfalls of Linear Regression, including its tendency to overfit and the challenge of irrelevant variables creeping into the model. Experience the classic tug of war between high variance and low bias.

Ridge Regression Savior:

Discover the unsung hero of Ridge Regression, equipped with a regularization term (alpha) to subtly adjust coefficients. Witness how Ridge Regression delicately balances overfitting and data integrity, offering a nuanced solution to model optimization.

Lasso Regression Bold Move:

Delve into the bold maverick of Lasso Regression, which doesn't mince words when it comes to eliminating irrelevant variables. Experience a Marie Kondo moment for your data as Lasso Regression zeroes in on the essentials, simplifying the model without compromising precision.

Key Insight:

Guard against overfitting by leveraging Ridge and Lasso Regression techniques. While Ridge tactfully adjusts coefficients to preserve data integrity, Lasso takes a direct approach by eliminating irrelevant variables. The choice between the two depends on the desired flavor for your model â€“ precision or simplicity.


Conclusion:

This project offers a deep dive into the world of Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression techniques, providing valuable insights into their strengths, pitfalls, and applications in machine learning. Gain a comprehensive understanding of each regression method and learn how to effectively address overfitting challenges while optimizing model performance.
